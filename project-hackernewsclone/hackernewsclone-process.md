# Making a Clone of Hacker NewsAPI

## Project Overview

As a way to utilize my new JavaScript skills and keep my HTML and CSS from getting stale, I undertook a side project of making a clone of Hacker News (which I called *Nosey News*) using an API. I started out with a basic version, using NewsAPI.org. For this one, I stuck with a very minimal approach, building off of a lesson from Bloc. I basically wanted to get something working so I could then play around with styling using the JS `then` promise code and CSS.


## The Basic Version

As a web development student at Bloc, I did an exercise to code a JS fetch to take the News API data and return a `ul` of articles as `li`s. I basically expanded upon this idea while styling it in my own way.

## The Advanced Version

This will happen as I learn more things! I would like to implement the following:

- color coded based on subject ("As a user, I would like article headings to be color coded based on subject so I can easily spot the topics that interest me")
- filter based on subject ("As a user, I would like to be able to filter the results based on subject so I can easily find the topics that interest me")
- authentication integration of some sort
- maybe pull in related images, like Google News does
