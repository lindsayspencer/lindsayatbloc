- Technical Communication: ability to talk through your code and explain things to others, which is important to working on teams and collaborating with other developers
- Confidence: self-doubt and imposter syndrome can be real struggles, but if you don't believe you can do it, no one else will - act with confidence and the feeling will follow

## My Ratings

**Interpersonal Communication: 8.5/10**

I am very good with people. It is easy for me to have positive interactions with people. It is not as easy for me to pursue relationships with people, establishing a connection, especially solely online. I find that some of this insecurity comes from confidence, so I have been working on improving that. Utilizing social media more has been one of my ways to practice communicating with people online. I am also excited to start going to coding meetups in my area where I can meet people face-to-face, which is more comfortable for me. I plan on going to one starting in November that meets every two weeks, so the regularity of it will provide opportunities to build rapport with other regular attendees.

**Accountability: 9/10**

I am very organized with my schedule and committed to punctuality, timely communication, and accomplishing tasks. One thing I want to work on is investing time in side projects that are not necessary or do not have a deadline to motivate me. One project I started to try and help with this is a GitHub repository (called lindsayatbloc) for blogging my Bloc experience and posting my own code exercises. This will give me practice doing something I am not required to do, but I know will benefit me in the long run.

**Technical Skills: 8.5/10**

I am very happy with how quickly I have learned coding so far. I have also had prior experience teaching myself a good amount of code, as I taught myself HTML and CSS at my last job to run and eventually rebuild their website. I worry, though, that I will have a hard time mastering the more complex coding skills and teaching myself new skills or other languages in the future to the point that I could implement them effectively at work. This insecurity is mostly based in a lack of confidence, though, because as I just said I've technically already done this before! To help in this area, I am trying to read other articles and tutorials outside of Bloc to gain as much knowledge and familiarity with reading technical writing as I can.   

**Technical Communication: 6/10**

I am more confident in my technical skills than my technical communication. I can say the definitions of technical words, but when using them all to explain a piece of code, I start second guessing myself. I will practice this with my mentor during our meetings and through writing about code in my GitHub repo.

**Confidence: 5/10**

This is my lowest rating because I know it's what I struggle with the most and the primary cause of my insecurities in the other categories. I have more confidence when I am doing something than when I tell people I can do something. I think one thing that will help with this is having sharable links to code I have created, so if I'm feeling less than confident talking about what I can do, I have something tangible I created to share. I also plan to attend the group sessions on confidence related topics and to start using the phrase "I am a web developer" so I can start believing it myself.

**Resilience and Grit: 7.5/10**

I know I struggle with emotional resilience, but it is something I have started to work on the last few months. I tend to take things, including rejection, very personally, instead of being confident in my own skills and worth and knowing there is a place that will recognize that, too. Having a clear vision of where I want to be and what I want to achieve will help me with emotional resilience. I also commit to doing something productive after experiencing rejection (such as finding another job to apply for when I get a "no"), which I find helps me not get stuck in a negative rut.
