# Git Workflow

Using the version control software Git is practically necessary now to track changes in your code and allow teams to seamlessly work on the same project. It is the virtual assistant, there to keep your work organized and under control. If you're new to using Git, here is an overview of how to use it in your next project.

## How It Works

Git is a version control software, which basically means it is a program that helps track the various changes and "versions" of your code throughout a project. The command line is used to access the Git software and tell it what to do. Other programs like Git Bash are also available so you do not have to use your computer's actual command prompt.

When Git starts tracking a certain project, a **repository** is made for all the information it records. A repository will contain **commits** and **branches**.

A commit is a snapshot of the code at the time of saving (called "committing") to the Git repository. It also contains any notes from the developer detailing what was done since the last commit. Because Git tracks all of this information, you can easily see each stage of the project files as they were built by looking through the commits made during the project.

The branches of a repository will include a master branch (the live code) as well as other branches cloned from the master. While the master branch is automatically created when initializing a repository, you can create cloned branches at any time, In these cloned branches, changes can be made and tested without affecting the master branch. A cloned branch can be merged with the master once the code is tested and accurate.

Commits allow developers to track the history of a project, while branches make it possible to work on files without changing the originals until they are tested. And all of this is meticulously tracked and preserved by Git in the project's repository.


## Setting Up a Repository




A **local repository** is saved locally on your computer, while a **remote repository** is saved externally, such as on a site like Github. Saving a repository remotely ensures the information is backed up in case something happens to your local device, and it makes the repository files available from anywhere. You can view your own project on any computer, or clone it to another device and keep working on it locally.
